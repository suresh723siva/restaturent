    <h1>1.The Sandwich Gallery</h1>
    <p>
      <span>Images of food tend to make us hungry </span>(remember the old
      saying “eyes bigger than the stomach”). However, making certain food look
      appetizing and beautiful is quite a skill. The Sandwich Gallery is a
      brunch place that serves all the classics like avocado toast, eggs and
      even<span> burgers</span> for those much-needed hungover meals. This menu
      design is exceptional as it takes the diner on a trip around the world
      with each sandwich-type of food representing one city in the world. The
      photos are paired with subtle illustrations and all the key information is
      included, like food cost, ingredients and calories.

    <h1>2. Zaliv</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      Appetizers, entrees and desserts are all found on separate pages, and
      subcategorized as cold and hot starters, BBQ and fish dishes. Despite the
      abundance of food, the menu design still doesn't look cluttered—a stylish
      blue background makes
      <span> menu look like some sort of food magazine.</span>
      This menu design example makes very clever use of photography. Instead of
      shots of single items, all the plates are laid out together, as if they
      were presented on a stylish dining table.

      A website with a different approach to their restaurant menu design is
      <span>Smokey Bones</span>. They were chosen an interesting way to share
      all the different types of food they offer by using them as submenu items
      and allowing visitors to find what they were looking for in a few clicks
      People can also directly go to the general menu page where the food types
      are beautifully presented and easy to navigate through.

    <h1>3.Mugs</h1>
    <center><img src="mugs.png" height="40%" width="50%" /></center>
    <p>
      We re going to start off with the awesome restaurant menu design of
      <span>Mugs</span>. The menu on this website is nothing like you’ve ever
      come across. Besides the awesome visuals, there are also effects on scroll
      that literally guide you through the assortment. This website shows
      clearly that you don’t have to stick with what’s expected from a menu. You
      can make the menu match your restaurant’s brand and attract various
      audiences. When clicking on a type of food, instead of being redirected to
      another page, you all see a slider popup appear that all make it very easy
      to discover the other food types as well.

    <h1>4.Soya</h1>
    <p>
      The point of photos in menu design is usually to show your guests what
      they can expect on their plates. But photos are a powerful tool,
      especially if you are a restaurateur specializing in a specific, exotic
      cuisine. They can educate customers about the cultural tradition or the
      cooking process itself.<br />
      This appetizers page concept for an Asian fusion restaurant uses “behind
      the scenes” photos, instead of the common sushi plates or rice bowls.v

    <p>
      If you’re designing a menu with illustrations on the cover, this
      restaurant menu card is a great source of inspiration. Line illustration
      style is always a great choice as it’s easy to incorporate into any
      design. Opt for a simple color palette and a neutral background to achieve
      a timeless look.
